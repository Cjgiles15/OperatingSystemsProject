# OperatingSystemsProject


This project uses 4 different scheduling algorithms to sort text files

The output is the same for each algorithm, however when the project is ran the user
can see the order that each file is being sorted

The 4 algorithms are as follows
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest job First (SJF)
- Prority
- Round Robin (RR)

Information from the config.txt file changes how each of these algorithms run. For more information please
see the projects specifications document.
